#Notes

- Data-binding in Angular is the auto syncing of data between the model and the view, and let's you treat the model as a 'single source of truth' in the app. The view is the projection of the model at all times
- When the model changes, the view changes and vice-versa

- It kinda works like this;
  - The template (view) is compiled in the browser. 
  - When the view is in use, and change updates the model, and vice-versa
